        "movement": "Like Puff, you do not want to scrap with Falco at close range.\nHis D-Air lasts forever and covers the entire area around him.\nAlong with his shine, being close to him almost always means you'll end up being combo-ed.\n\nSo VS Falco, you will want to play a walling game.\n\nYou want to stay far enough away where you can dash back his attacks, but close enough where you can still hit his dash back with dash attack or burst at him jumping in place.\nOnce you have gotten into this position, you will play footies with the Falco with his burst options and lazers.\n",
        "gameplan": "Falco is all about keeping up pressure, so Marth's job is to alleviated as much of this pressure as he can.\n\nFalco's primary tools are all aerials (excluding a few), meaning he has to jump to get anything done, we can exploit this in a variety of ways.\n\nYou will need to watch where the Falco likes to jump and how he does it.\n\n<h3>N-Air</h3>\nSince Falco will primarily come from the air, we can use an In-Place N-Air to counter hit his approach.\nHowever, *do not spam* this N-Air without mixing up out of the auto cancel.\nExamples of what to do are dash back, crouch for a power-shield, WD forwards or empty hop.\n\nThis will cover most of Falco's immediate approaches, however, this is a short window where you are vulnerable from doing a N-Air, so the Falco may want to do an aerial to beat this.\n\n<h3>Dash-Back</h3>\nWhen Falco wants to hit you for doing anything that isn't N-Air-ing in place, he will probably approach with an aerial. This is where you should be mixing in dash backs to whiff punish these.\nFurthermore, in the dash back animation, Marth gets access to the \"floating power-shield\" witch makes it easier to PS Falco's lazers.\n\n<h3>Falco retreating / playing pasive</h3>\nIf the Falco likes to retreat (dash back / jump back) or play passively (jumping in place / lazer in place), you can call this out by bursting into him with an aerial (F-Air / N-Air) or a ground move if you can get it out in time (dash attack, F-Smash or Grab)\n\n<h3>Empty Hops In Center</h3>\nWhen holding center, you do not want to push into Falco.\nThis is because if you do, and he get's past you, you can get stuck in the corner.\nInstead, you wan't to abuse that Falco is weaker in the corner as he can no longer play passive, meaning he has to push out or risk being hit.\n\nA good way to do this is to empty hop, as this allows you to react to his options whilst also not putting you into any lag.\n\nIf he lazers you, you can F-Air, and if he decides to aerial, you can hit it with an aerial or mix up and dash back.\n\n<h3>Take Lazer Fair</h3>\nTake lazer F-Air is useful for when Falco tries to approach with lazer, or you want to call out his lazer and position yourself to counter hit.\nAfter the F-Air, many times you have enough time to grab Falco.\n\nIf you do not hit Falco, it becomes a mix up scenario in your favour, as to get anything out of it, the Falco must risk doing something, else you now have the space.\n\n<h3>Power-shielding</h3>\nWhen power-shielding, you will want to WD forwards or backwards with different lengths after reflecting the projectile.\n\nThis is one of the only ways to safely approach Falco in this MU, as any other attempt to push will probably get you hit.\n\nIf the Falco is far away (out side of burst range), WD in is completely safe.\n\n<h3>Falco Above You</h3>\nWhen Falco is above you (like on a platform or from him full-hopping), you can shark with U-Airs and F-Airs.\nU-Airs are better when he is on a platform and in-front of you (like if he tries to hold away), where F-Air is better if he is above you / trying to land onto you from above.\n\n<h3>Falco In The Corner</h3>\nWhen Falco is in the corner, you shouldn't run at him, he will mostly always try to work his way back to center, meaning you can wall him out without risking getting stuck in the corner yourself.\nHowever, if the Falco does not want to leave the corner, you can poke at him with N-Airs, F-Airs and F-Smashes to get him to move.",
        "respect": "<h3>N-Air / D-Air</h3>\nFalco's bread and butter approach options that can lead into big damage, a kill or an edge guard situation.\n\nThese are beaten out buy spacing a N-Air so that it out ranges his attack\nIf he does an approach aerial (overshoot or approaching), in-place N-Air is better\n\nHowever, if he undershoots / in-place N-Air's, its better to try and grab him if your close enough, otherwise whiff punish with a dash attack.\n\nIf you are not close enough for a punish, you can use his end-lag as time to reposition yourself so next time you can punish it.\n\n<h3>Shine</h3>\nThis *IS* Falco's best combo tool.\nUp-close, this move is stupid VS Marth as you have no other options that can out speed it (it's frame 1 lol).\nHowever, unlike Fox, this move is tiny, most of front of Falco doesn't have a hit-box; his head and feet and his hand ever so slightly sticks out in-front of him.\nThis means, if your in-front of Falco, you are mostly safe from Shine (unless he WD in Shine)\nDue to his slow Dash speed, Falco often doesn't run in shine, but wave dashes in, however, due to his jump squat, his WD is rather slow and react-able, meaning Falco's normally Shine as a whiff punish or combo into it\n\nThis means Falco only really uses Shine up close, meaning if you space correctly, you shouldn't be hit by it.\n\nFurther more, due to its size, you can conformably whiff punish it without fear of being counter hit, as Marth's disjoint will hit though it / grab will grab him (if timed properly)\n\n<h3>Approaching Lazer</h3>\nIf the Falco approaches with lazers, there are 2 ways to beat him, before the lazer comes out and after.\n\n<h4>Before</h4>\nIf the Falco does a lazer / jumps close enough to you, you can beat it out before he gets it out.\nN-Air / F-Air is a easy way to hit him for this.\nN-Air is better for when he is higher / you want to baet him jumping close to you.\nF-Air is better when he does a low / late lazer, as it allows you to jump over him and hit him from above with F-Air's better coverage.\n\n<h4>After</h4>\nAerial lazer has 13 frames of start up, so with a 5 frame jumps squat, make it 18 frame, easily react-able too, this aids in Marth's best tool VS lazers, take lazer into F-Air.\nThis is the best way to beat approaching lazers, and is why empty hopping in center is so good, as you can beat out his best approach option from the corner.\n\nOne thing to note, if your too close to the floor, you might hit it before getting a F-Air out, to combat this, you can SDI / ASDI the lazer up when getting hit by it, allowing you to get the F-Air out.\n\nThis F-Air then can combo into grab as Falco is holding in to approach.\n\nIf, when choosing to do an aerial and you get hit by lazer, you should do take lazer F-Air.\n\n<h3>In-Place Lazer</h3>\nLazer in place is risky for Falco, as if the Marth has positioned himself correctly, he can cover / create a favourable mix up.\n\nLazer in place can be beaten by slight drift in N-Air, this also allows you to be-able to take lazer F-Air if he hits you with the Lazer.\n\nA mix up is to PS WD in grab, this beats the Falco trying to hold an area with lazers.\n\nIf your spaced right, you can also dash attack his jump, this creates a mix up situation, tech chase or combo opportunity depending on DI.\n\n<h3>Retreating Lazer</h3>\nRetreating lazers are the hardest to deal with.\nThe best way to deal with them is to PS and WD forwards, this forces the Falco to stop doing them as it pushes them into the corner.\n\nIf you want to attack them, you can overshoot with N-Air or dash attack, but guessing wring will lead to a big punish by Falco, so use theses with caution.\n\n<h3>F-Smash</h3>\nFalco has alot of good ground moves but not alot of movement for those ground moves, the one exception si F-Smash.\n\nThis move goes, really far, and is very big, when walling out Falco, you want to make sure that you are not in range of this move, as it can go under N-Air at times.\n\nAdditionally, it only has 17 frames of end lag, but it is very ambiguous where the move ends.\n\nThere is a reaction point at frame 26, where you can see his 2nd foot apear from behind him, but that leaves 13 frames to punish, so you have to be quick about it.\nGrab and dash attack are good for whiff punishing it, else a F-Air in place should stuff it out.\n\n<h3>D-Tilt / CC</h3>\nAlthough CC VS Falco might not be good due to his D-Air, he can still CC Marth's moves if he think you will try to hit him.\n\nIf you space correctly, he shouldn't be-able to punish your whiffed moves (N-Air auto cancels -> dash back) as his dash is slow, however, badly spaced moves are easily CC'ed and punished by F-Smash and his surprisingly strong D-Tilt.\n\n<h3>Full Hop</h3>\nFalco has one of the highest reaches in the game, his full hop with his double jump allows him to practically get any where vertical wise.\n\nThis means being above Falco is a no go, this also means trying to go around him vertically is hard.\n\nHowever, when he chooses to go up there, he has to come down. His excellent D-Air helps him land alot of the time, but luckily, Marth has a sword that can bairly out range this massive D-Air. If you do not time / space properly though, your hand might get hit by the D-Air.\n\nIf Falco is above you / full hops, you will want to try to catch his landings with short hop U-Airs, this also works when he goes to platforms.\nHowever, if the Falco chooses to not to land, but to contest your U-Airs, its better to use F-Air, as U-Air has Marth's hand quite vulnerable for a few frame, so F-Air is better at beating out D-Air directly, but may lead into less when catching landings, but since Falco is probably holding in when trying to land on you, it will lead into a combo.\n\nFinally, if he decides not to even try getting hit and running far away from you, you can catch his landings with dash attack, F-Smash or grab. Alternately, if you think these won't hit, you can take the space as Falco is now cornered, and you can hold center.\n\n",

        "punish": "<h3>Tech chasing</h3>\nFalco's tech animations are much easier to react to than Foxes, meaning Marth has an easier time tech chasing him.\n\n<h3>Platform Tech chasing</h3>\nGetting Falco onto a platform allows you to start sharking him.\nBellow about 20% (I think, its not exact number, need to find it) you should use U-Tilt, as U-Air doesn't work as well till after that %\n\n<h3>U-Throw Chain grab</h3>\nYou cannot U-Throw at 0%, also at certain %s, he can DI and shine you?\nIt literally at specific %s tho, so if your pummelling right, you shouldn't be caught by this.\n",
        "edge_guarding": "When edge guarding Falco, the most important thing is to get him bellow the point where he can Side-B, if you can do this, you can always kill him.\n\n<h3>Side-B</h3>\nThis goes further than Foxes Side-B and is faster, so it should be harder to react to, but due to Falco primarily using this to recover, we can focus on it before up b.\n\nYou can go offstage VS him if you have a read on where he will Side-B, as this will result in him not being able to recover, but beware, as his Side-B meteors, so you will need to meteor cancel to live, and he may just be ready with a D-Air after, resulting in your death.\n\nThe best way to cover for Side-B is to stand just a bit back from ledge, where your F-Air can be used to hit ledge.\nThen when Falco Side-Bs, he will try 1 of 3 \"areas\" to recover too\n\n<h4>Very High</h4>\nSome times the Falco will recover very high, this means he will be aiming for ether to top platform or to go over you to center.\nThis options normally can be reacted to and you can punish his landing.\n\n<h4>High</h4>\nThis refers to where Falco will try to go to a side Platform.\nThis can be covered by short hop F-Air-ing or N-Air-ing in-front of him.\nF-Air is better closer to the ledge, as closer to center, it may just result in a reset, not an edge guard or combo as he might be hit with sour spot.\n\n<h4>Mid</h4>\nThis is where Falco tries to Side-B into your face.\nThis is easily covered with a double jab in reaction to the sound queue.\nYou can also short hop F-Air this if timed right.\n\n<h4>Low</h4>\nThis is where Falco attempts to get to ledge, but is still high enough to hit.\nHere you can Jab or D-Tilt, D-Tilt is slower than Jab but lasts for longer and if you ledge hog after D-Tilt, Falco is just dead.\nYou can also F-Air this recovery by fast falling it.\n\n<h4>Very Low</h4>\nFinally, if the Falco sweet-spots ledge, you can ledge hog or D-Air his Side-B.\n\nA common trend with Side-B is that F-Air can cover all of them, however the timing for it is hard, and if you are not spaced correctly, you can just reset the situation.\n\n<h3>Up B</h3>\nIt has no hit box on charge up, and does not go as far, if you are spaced correctly, go and F-Air / Up-B / D-Air / ledge hog it.\nIf he is bellow the ledge and tries to hit you, you can also counter it.\n",

This forces Falco to ether shield pressure you, witch since your in the corner, will put you back to ledge, resetting the situation, or grabbing you, witch he shouldn't get anything off of, maybe an edge guard situation if he F-Throws, but DI will let you get back fairly consistently.\n\nAfter he starts going for grab or ways to beat the shield, you can start mixing up by rolling in, dashing, or jumping to a platform or over him to get to center.\n\n<h2>Platform Slide Offs</h2>\nYou can slide off his D-Air if you land onto a platform.\nThis stops him from being able to platform tech chase you, and allows you to maybe get a U-Air off it.\n\n",

This makes it really easy to react to and hit him.\nIf he goes bellow ledge, you can grab the ledge for i-frames and go off and B-Air him.\nIf he is far enough out, you can run off and Up-B the Side-B / him going low.\nAlthough these options loose to Marth Up-B-ing early.\n\nIf he is horizontal to the ledge and is close enough, run off fair works to push him back.\n\nIf he is above the ledge and close enough, then you continue to shark him with F-Airs and B-Airs.",
