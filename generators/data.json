        "punish": "Marth has a terrible time coming directly down, so we can exploit this.\nJust like Sheik, you will want to find your way underneath Marth, and shark him with U-Airs, F-Airs and U-Tilts.\nAfter not allowing Marth down, you will be pushing him to the corners, meaning as with Fox, you can then try to finish him off with a D-Air / F-Smash / Up-B, however, if Marth is at a higher %, these often wont connect, witch is fine as Marth's edge guarding is really good vs him self.",
        "edge_guarding": "Edge guarding Marth is the key to killing him early.\n\nYou will mostly be spaced to hit bad up B angles with D-Tilt / F-Smash.\nOnce the Marth shows (or you know) he will mix up how he grabs the ledge, you can start to ledge hog and start to hit him offstage.\n\n<h3>Side-B</h3>\nMarth Side-B has 21 frames of recovery in the air and stalls him in one spot vertically. This makes it really easy to react to and hit him.\nIf he goes bellow ledge, you can grab the ledge for i-frames and go off and B-Air him.\nIf he is far enough out, you can run off and Up-B the Side-B / him going low.\nAlthough these options loose to Marth Up-B-ing early.\n\nIf he is horizontal to the ledge and is close enough, run off fair works to push him back.\n\nIf he is above the ledge and close enough, then you continue to shark him with F-Airs and B-Airs.",
