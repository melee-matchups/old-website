	## Movement
		The way to beat Fox is to out manoeuvre him
		You must keep pace with his obligatory bullshit, space around it and punish hard when given an opening
		ALLWAYS be looking at the Fox, you will not be able to react to his shit otherwise.

		You must be comfortable with moving around to make a perfectly spaced neutral.
		Dash dancing is preferred VS Fox at close range, Wave Dash and Shield Drops should be used for clean platform movement.
		However, You do not want to be dash dancing on the other side of the stage, this will allow the Fox to not be pressured by your sword and grab.
		You want to be dash dancing to push towards Fox, this will force the Fox to act or run away.

	## Gameplan
		Once your are within distance of Foxes burst range, you will be play off of these options.
		The most common options for Fox come after a dash or a SH, You will need to react to witch he choses and punish accordingly.
		Additionally, you will need to observe if the Fox wishes to over extend or dash back.
		
		After this you will want to push him offstage to gimp or edge guard him.

	## Options to respect

		### Shine
			Fox has many a option to rush-down Marth with, the most deadly of witch is his Shine.
			Shine can be beaten by predicting where he will do it (as an undershoot or overshoot) and grabbing before or after he does it.
			If the fox is overshooting his shine, dashing forwards to grab him before he gets it out is a good option.
			You can also do a in-place option to beat it out such as SH delayed in-place FF fair or in-place D-Tilt.
			If the Fox decides to do an aerial instead, you will want to try to ether whiff punish it with grab or beat it out with your sword.

		### Aerials
			To make sure he doesn't try to attack your dash backs, you will need to mix in in-place options.
			In-place / drift back AC N-Air is good for catching an overshoot N-Air / D-Air, but is susceptible to being hit from other options due to its small effective coverage.
			In-place / drift back instant SHFFL F-Air is also good for catching an overshoot aerials and will also cover for full-hop aerials.
			In-place D-Tilt is good after other options to catch the Fox running at you with unthoughtful approaches, however you don't want to be walling out with D-Tilt.

			After you do N-Air / F-Air, you will need to mix-up what you do after it, such as a dash away, dash forwards, shield, D-Tilt, grab or something else; The key thing is to mix up what you do after so you don't get punished.

		### Dash dancing
			If the Fox decides to dash dance / delay their approach, you can use D-Tilt to poke and provoke the Fox to approach.
			You can do this by doing a run cancel D-Tilt to catch his dash back.
			If the Fox is weary of the above option, wave dash D-Tilt also works to catch them dashing back in.
			You can also try to use a riskier option such as dash attack and f-smash to call out the Fox.
		
		### Grab
			Fox can get a 0-50% combo off of U-Throw -> U-Air; However this can be alleviated by SDI-ing the U-Air.
			Fox can grab you if you do not mix up your aerials and if you dash back too much.
		
		## Burst kill options
			At high %s Fox has alot of burst kill options or options that lead to a kill.
			These include:
				- Grab
				- U-Smash
				- U-Air
				- Shine
			These can be dealt with the same way as before, however the risk reward is skewed heavily for Fox, as a slip up and your dead.
			It's better to play more cautious of these options at high %s.

	## Options not to respect
		Lazars are surprisingly unsafe at close distances, so punish him for it if he doesn't want to approach.
		Dash attack, F-Smash and Grab are good for this.

# Punish Game

	## Punish routes
		Fox is the fastest faller in the game, this allows Marth to basically indefinitely juggle Fox.
		However, you do not want to juggle him forever, as Fox above you at high % isn't really that good due to his fast fall speed.
		This means you want to use juggling as a means to combo him into a finisher.
		
		You will want to ether:
			- Ladder combo him above a platform so you can land on the platform and F-Smash him.
			- Juggle him off stage into a D-Air, Up-B or F-Smash.
	
	## Key Combos
		U-Tilt -> D-Air
		F-Air -> D-Air
		U-Air -> D-Air
		U-Air -> F-Smash
		
		Grab follow ups

	## Edge Guarding
		Be smart, you must be aware of where and when the Fox wishes to do something
		You must position yourself differently depending on what the Fox likes to do
		
		### Side-B
			If he is above ledge, you must be ready for him to side b to a platform or at you.
			These can be covered by a N-Air / F-Air before or just after the ledge.
			
			He can also choose to try to snap to the ledge. If he does not space correctly, you can D-Tilt the side B.
			Otherwise, you will need to D-Air or ledge hog the Side-B.
			
			I found I can also use Neutral-B to cover ledge for side Bs, however this is really slow and is more of a call out.
		
		### Up-B
			Up-B can be covered in many ways depending on the angle by the Fox.
			
			#### Above ledge
				If fox is above ledge and far enough away from you, he with ether Up B:
				- towards you / to ledge, witch you can cover with a F-Air / F-Smash.
				- to a platform, witch you can F-Air / N-Air (later %s).
				- horizontality to stage, witch you can F-Smash
				
				If Fox is close enough, you can go out and D-Air / F-Air him.
				
			#### Below ledge
				If it will hit you, you can opt for a counter; However, if the Fox can snap to ledge, you can mix it up and hog the ledge or D-Air him.
				If Fox is close enough to the ledge when he Up-Bs, you can use the ledge i-frames to go and hit the fox with side B, B-Air or F-Air.
				
				If the Fox is further away but still in reach, you should go out and F-Air / Up-B him.
				
				If he aims for the ledge, you can D-Air him, however watch out he does not wall tech it.

	## Throw Follow ups
		
		### Low %
			Do one of:
			- U-Throw: The chain grab
			- F-Throw: D-Tilt (at ledge) / Re-Grab / Tech chase
		
		### Mid %
			Do one of:
			- U-Throw: Juggle
			- F-Throw: D-Tilt (at ledge) / Mix-Up off platform / Tech chase
		
		### High %
			Do one of:
			- D-Throw: Tech chase
			- B-Throw: Tech chase
			- F-Throw: D-Tilt (at ledge) / Mix-Up off platform / Tech chase
			
		
# Defence

	## Recovery
	
		Watch out for his shine, try not to be too close to the ledge for too long as that's where it is most potent, be quick and decisive on where you want to go, as a hesitation is all the Fox needs to shine spike you

# -=-=-=-=-=-= OLD SHIT IGNORE PLEASE, here because I like archiving stuff -=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The way to beat Fox is to out manoeuvre him
You must keep pace with his obligatory bullshit, space around it and punish hard when given an opening
ALLWAYS be looking at the Fox, you will not be able to react to his shit otherwise

You must be comfortable with moving around with DD and WD, combining the 2 to make a perfectly spaced neutral

After this has been achieve, you will be moving around the Fox's burst options, those most commonly being a dash or sh into a very fast move
You will need to react to witch he choses and punish accordingly
Additinaly, you will need to observe if the Fox wishes to over extend
The best way to stop this is to wall just outside of his dash distance, using fast fall fair and nair and dtilt to make sure he doesn't try to attack your dash backs, and to catch any unthoughtful approaches (tho these are more to threaten rather than try to hit him)

Finaly if the Fox decides that approaching is not game, then just run up dtilt / fair then GTFO of there, this should make them do shit most the time

You really do not want to approach Fox most the time, by approach, I mean be anywhere near him, since that's where he will be at his strongest, so the best position for you, is cornering him, so take space, but NEVER overextend on him, you can overshoot if he does not want to play for a prolonged period of time, otherwise keep your zone
