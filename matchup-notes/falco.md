	## Movement
		Like Puff, you do not want to scrap with Falco at close range.
		His D-Air lasts forever and covers the entire area around him.
		Along with his shine, being close to him almost always means you'll end up being combo-ed.
		
		So VS Falco, you will want to play a walling game.
		
		You want to stay far enough away where you can dash back his attacks, but close enough where you can still hit his dash back with dash attack or burst at him jumping in place.
		Once you have gotten into this position, you will play footies with the Falco with his burst options and lazers.

	## Gameplan
		Falco is all about keeping up pressure, so Marth's job is to alleviated as much of this pressure as he can.
		
		Falco's primary tools are all aerials (excluding a few), meaning he has to jump to get anything done, we can exploit this in a variety of ways.
		
		You will need to watch where the Falco likes to jump and how he does it.
		
		
		### N-Air
			Since Falco will primarily come from the air, we can use an In-Place N-Air to counter hit his approach.
			However, *do not spam* this N-Air without mixing up out of the auto cancel.
			Examples of what to do are dash back, crouch for a power-shield, WD forwards or empty hop.
			
			This will cover most of Falco's immediate approaches, however, this is a short window where you are vulnerable from doing a N-Air, so the Falco may want to do an aerial to beat this.
		
		### Dash-Back
			When Falco wants to hit you for doing anything that isn't N-Air-ing in place, he will probably approach with an aerial. This is where you should be mixing in dash backs to whiff punish these.
			Furthermore, in the dash back animation, Marth gets access to the "floating power-shield" witch makes it easier to PS Falco's lazers.
		
		### Falco retreating / playing pasive
			If the Falco likes to retreat (dash back / jump back) or play passively (jumping in place / lazer in place), you can call this out by bursting into him with an aerial (F-Air / N-Air) or a ground move if you can get it out in time (dash attack, F-Smash or Grab)
		
		### Empty Hops In Center
			When holding center, you do not want to push into Falco.
			This is because if you do, and he get's past you, you can get stuck in the corner.
			Instead, you wan't to abuse that Falco is weaker in the corner as he can no longer play passive, meaning he has to push out or risk being hit.
			
			A good way to do this is to empty hop, as this allows you to react to his options whilst also not putting you into any lag.
			
			If he lazers you, you can F-Air, and if he decides to aerial, you can hit it with an aerial or mix up and dash back.
			
		### Take Lazer Fair
			Take lazer F-Air is useful for when Falco tries to approach with lazer, or you want to call out his lazer and position yourself to counter hit.
			After the F-Air, many times you have enough time to grab Falco.
			
			If you do not hit Falco, it becomes a mix up scenario in your favour, as to get anything out of it, the Falco must risk doing something, else you now have the space.
			
		### Power-shielding
			When power-shielding, you will want to WD forwards or backwards with different lengths after reflecting the projectile.
			
			This is one of the only ways to safely approach Falco in this MU, as any other attempt to push will probably get you hit.
			
			If the Falco is far away (out side of burst range), WD in is completely safe.
		
		### Falco Above You
			When Falco is above you (like on a platform or from him full-hopping), you can shark with U-Airs and F-Airs.
			U-Airs are better when he is on a platform and in-front of you (like if he tries to hold away), where F-Air is better if he is above you / trying to land onto you from above.
		
		### Falco In The Corner
			When Falco is in the corner, you shouldn't run at him, he will mostly always try to work his way back to center, meaning you can wall him out without risking getting stuck in the corner yourself.
			However, if the Falco does not want to leave the corner, you can poke at him with N-Airs, F-Airs and F-Smashes to get him to move.
			
	## Options to respect
		
		### N-Air / D-Air
			Falco's bread and butter approach options that can lead into big damage, a kill or an edge guard situation.
			
			These are beaten out buy spacing a N-Air so that it out ranges his attack
			If he does an approach aerial (overshoot or approaching), in-place N-Air is better
			
			However, if he undershoots / in-place N-Air's, its better to try and grab him if your close enough, otherwise whiff punish with a dash attack.
			
			If you are not close enough for a punish, you can use his end-lag as time to reposition yourself so next time you can punish it.
			
		### Shine
			This *IS* Falco's best combo tool.
			Up-close, this move is stupid VS Marth as you have no other options that can out speed it (it's frame 1 lol).
			However, unlike Fox, this move is tiny, most of front of Falco doesn't have a hit-box; his head and feet and his hand ever so slightly sticks out in-front of him.
			This means, if your in-front of Falco, you are mostly safe from Shine (unless he WD in Shine)
			Due to his slow Dash speed, Falco often doesn't run in shine, but wave dashes in, however, due to his jump squat, his WD is rather slow and react-able, meaning Falco's normally Shine as a whiff punish or combo into it
			
			This means Falco only really uses Shine up close, meaning if you space correctly, you shouldn't be hit by it.
			
			Further more, due to its size, you can conformably whiff punish it without fear of being counter hit, as Marth's disjoint will hit though it / grab will grab him (if timed properly)
			
		### Approaching Lazer
			If the Falco approaches with lazers, there are 2 ways to beat him, before the lazer comes out and after.
			
			#### Before
				If the Falco does a lazer / jumps close enough to you, you can beat it out before he gets it out.
				N-Air / F-Air is a easy way to hit him for this.
				N-Air is better for when he is higher / you want to baet him jumping close to you.
				F-Air is better when he does a low / late lazer, as it allows you to jump over him and hit him from above with F-Air's better coverage.
			
			#### After
				Aerial lazer has 13 frames of start up, so with a 5 frame jumps squat, make it 18 frame, easily react-able too, this aids in Marth's best tool VS lazers, take lazer into F-Air.
				This is the best way to beat approaching lazers, and is why empty hopping in center is so good, as you can beat out his best approach option from the corner.
				
				One thing to note, if your too close to the floor, you might hit it before getting a F-Air out, to combat this, you can SDI / ASDI the lazer up when getting hit by it, allowing you to get the F-Air out.
				
				This F-Air then can combo into grab as Falco is holding in to approach.
			
			If, when choosing to do an aerial and you get hit by lazer, you should do take lazer F-Air.
			
		### In-Place Lazer
			Lazer in place is risky for Falco, as if the Marth has positioned himself correctly, he can cover / create a favourable mix up.
			
			Lazer in place can be beaten by slight drift in N-Air, this also allows you to be-able to take lazer F-Air if he hits you with the Lazer.
			
			A mix up is to PS WD in grab, this beats the Falco trying to hold an area with lazers.
			
			If your spaced right, you can also dash attack his jump, this creates a mix up situation, tech chase or combo opportunity depending on DI.
			
		### Retreating Lazer
			Retreating lazers are the hardest to deal with.
			The best way to deal with them is to PS and WD forwards, this forces the Falco to stop doing them as it pushes them into the corner.
			
			If you want to attack them, you can overshoot with N-Air or dash attack, but guessing wring will lead to a big punish by Falco, so use theses with caution.
			
		### F-Smash
			Falco has alot of good ground moves but not alot of movement for those ground moves, the one exception si F-Smash.
			
			This move goes, really far, and is very big, when walling out Falco, you want to make sure that you are not in range of this move, as it can go under N-Air at times.
			
			Additionally, it only has 17 frames of end lag, but it is very ambiguous where the move ends.
			
			There is a reaction point at frame 26, where you can see his 2nd foot apear from behind him, but that leaves 13 frames to punish, so you have to be quick about it.
			Grab and dash attack are good for whiff punishing it, else a F-Air in place should stuff it out.
			
		### D-Tilt / CC
			Although CC VS Falco might not be good due to his D-Air, he can still CC Marth's moves if he think you will try to hit him.
			
			If you space correctly, he shouldn't be-able to punish your whiffed moves (N-Air auto cancels -> dash back) as his dash is slow, however, badly spaced moves are easily CC'ed and punished by F-Smash and his surprisingly strong D-Tilt.
			
		### Full Hop
			Falco has one of the highest reaches in the game, his full hop with his double jump allows him to practically get any where vertical wise.
			
			This means being above Falco is a no go, this also means trying to go around him vertically is hard.
			
			However, when he chooses to go up there, he has to come down. His excellent D-Air helps him land alot of the time, but luckily, Marth has a sword that can bairly out range this massive D-Air. If you do not time / space properly though, your hand might get hit by the D-Air.
			
			If Falco is above you / full hops, you will want to try to catch his landings with short hop U-Airs, this also works when he goes to platforms.
			However, if the Falco chooses to not to land, but to contest your U-Airs, its better to use F-Air, as U-Air has Marth's hand quite vulnerable for a few frame, so F-Air is better at beating out D-Air directly, but may lead into less when catching landings, but since Falco is probably holding in when trying to land on you, it will lead into a combo.
			
			Finally, if he decides not to even try getting hit and running far away from you, you can catch his landings with dash attack, F-Smash or grab. Alternately, if you think these won't hit, you can take the space as Falco is now cornered, and you can hold center.
		
	## Options not to respect
		
		### Grab
			Falco does not get anything\* off a grab, aslong as you DI and SDI his lazer (you go really far when doing this) then she should never get anything off it apart from positioning.
			
			\* when at ledge, Falco may U-Throw, if you DI wrong, he might be able to D-Air spike you, please DI correctly.
			
# Punish Game

	## Punish routes
	
		### Tech chasing
			Falco's tech animations are much easier to react to than Foxes, meaning Marth has an easier time tech chasing him.
		
		### Platform Tech chasing
			Getting Falco onto a platform allows you to start sharking him.
			Bellow about 20% (I think, its not exact number, need to find it) you should use U-Tilt, as U-Air doesn't work as well till after that %
		
		### U-Throw Chain grab
			You cannot U-Throw at 0%, also at certain %s, he can DI and shine you?
			It literally at specific %s tho, so if your pummelling right, you shouldn't be caught by this.
	
	## Combos
		- FD Chain grab 0-Death
		- F-Air -> D-Air
		- (Take lazer (SDI up)) F-Air -> Grab

	## Edge Guarding
		When edge gaurding Falco, the most important thing is to get him bellow the point where he can Side-B, if you can do this, you can always kill him.
		
		### Side-B
			This goes further than Foxes Side-B and is faster, so it should be harder to react to, but due to Falco primarily using this to recover, we can focus on it before up b.
			
			You can go offstage VS him if you have a read on where he will Side-B, as this will result in him not being able to recover, but beware, as his Side-B meteors, so you will need to meteor cancel to live, and he may just be ready with a D-Air after, resulting in your death.
			
			The best way to cover for Side-B is to stand just a bit back from ledge, where your F-Air can be used to hit ledge.
			Then when Falco Side-Bs, he will try 1 of 3 "areas" to recover too
			
			#### Very High
				Some times the Falco will recover very high, this means he will be aiming for ether to top platform or to go over you to center.
				This options normally can be reacted to and you can punish his landing.
			
			#### High
				This refers to where Falco will try to go to a side Platform.
				This can be covered by short hop F-Air-ing or N-Air-ing in-front of him.
				F-Air is better closer to the ledge, as closer to center, it may just result in a reset, not an edge guard or combo as he might be hit with sour spot.
			
			#### Mid
				This is where Falco tries to Side-B into your face.
				This is easily covered with a double jab in reaction to the sound queue.
				You can also short hop F-Air this if timed right.
			
			#### Low
				This is where Falco attempts to get to ledge, but is still high enough to hit.
				Here you can Jab or D-Tilt, D-Tilt is slower than Jab but lasts for longer and if you ledge hog after D-Tilt, Falco is just dead.
				You can also F-Air this recovery by fast falling it.
			
			#### Very Low
				Finally, if the Falco sweet-spots ledge, you can ledge hog or D-Air his Side-B.
			
			A common trend with Side-B is that F-Air can cover all of them, however the timing for it is hard, and if you are not spaced correctly, you can just reset the situation.
		
		### Up B
			It has no hit box on charge up, and does not go as far, if you are spaced correctly, go and F-Air / Up-B / D-Air / ledge hog it.
			If he is bellow the ledge and tries to hit you, you can also counter it.

	## Throw Follow ups
		
		### 0 %
			F-Throw re-grab, if they DI in, thi8s true combos, but if they DI out, then U-Throw re-grab combos, its a mix up, but most the time, they dont DI F-Throw in time due to its speed, so default to F-Throw at 0
		
		### Low %
			Chain grab if you want, but its harder than Fox due to Falco's weight
			You can also use F-Throw tech chasing if you want.
		
		### Mid %
			U-Throw -> U-air -> F-Smash if possible
			Else U-Throw -> Imagination
		
		### High %
			U-Throw -> N-Air
			or
			F-Throw -> Tech chase Up B
				
		
# Defence
	
	## Falco Shield Pressure And Playing From The Corner
		When in the corner, you want to find you way back to center, however, if the Falco is playing hot, this is a hard task.
		If you find yourself cornered, the first thing to do is not to panic.
		I used to always try to grab him or jump out, this is very VERY bad.
		
		The best option I have found is to light shield in the corner. This forces Falco to ether shield pressure you, witch since your in the corner, will put you back to ledge, resetting the situation, or grabbing you, witch he shouldn't get anything off of, maybe an edge guard situation if he F-Throws, but DI will let you get back fairly consistently.
		
		After he starts going for grab or ways to beat the shield, you can start mixing up by rolling in, dashing, or jumping to a platform or over him to get to center.
		
	## Platform Slide Offs
		You can slide off his D-Air if you land onto a platform.
		This stops him from being able to platform tech chase you, and allows you to maybe get a U-Air off it.
		
	## Recovery
		If you are even in stocks, be weary of his D-Air on ledge, you have to sweet-spot the further out bit of the grab box to be able to avoid it.
		Furthermore, he can D-Smash if you get too close, so make sure to space for these.
		
		Additionally, he can cover very high and low at the same time, so you can't really jump over him back to stage.
		
		If your down a stock or he is a higher % than you, you will also need to watch out for a suicide D-Air, this is nearly impossible to dodge if your bellow the stage, but can be mixed up so he can't get to you.
