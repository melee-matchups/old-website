# Stuff to add

Juggle + edge guards are important.
PUNISH is important

## Edge guards

When offstage, give them a 30-40% chance they will die
When juggling, make them eat % or leave them in disadvantage.

Shield when he far out to cover miss-fire
Spike/D-Tilt Side-B as they come towards you.

D-Air in place at ledge if they attack from bellow.

If they wall hug, run off DJ D-Air (need time to setup) but will cover Luigi DJ / Up-B

Can always D-Tilt Luigi Up-B, he can't sweet-spot it.
After you D-Tilt them, edge hog and their dead.

If he aims for platform (to get his DJ back), hit him with F-Air / U-Air / U-Tilt

DJ Fireball can be beaten by Ledge hog -> DJ D-Air
If you don't have time to grab ledge, Jab the fireball, then walk forwards and Jab him

## Juggles

Falling U-Air is better to cover a landing spot (requires start up [need SH -> FF, 12 frames]).
Rising U-Air is a vertical dash attack, if your certain it will hit, go for it.

F-Air & B-Air are more instant, and simply the juggle game as pushed them towards ledge (can Ken Combo).

U-Air resets the situation, F-Air & B-Air pushes them for edge guard / Ken combo.

Juggle is advantage state, you don't have to always try to hit them -> Pushes them to the corner.

Not get reversal -> Don't get hit.

Juggling pick safer option, if 50/50, one to get hit, one to drop but still have stage control, pick stage control.

Juggles priorities not getting hit.

DJ or not.

U-Throw -> Obverse
1. Center
2. Find possible hits
3. Maintain advantage (don't get hit)

U-Tilt when they try to land on-top of you with no resources.

## Weaknesses
Luigi's strengths -> Ground game
Luigi's WD U-Smash is safe on shield

Horrible air game

Full Hop?
