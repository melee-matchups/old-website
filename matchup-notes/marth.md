	## Movement (HOW play)
		You will want to try and hold center, walling out using D-Tilt to control the ground and stuff movement.
		WD forwards is risky in this MU, but needs to be used to poke at Marth when he is dash dancing
		You can dash back to whiff punish Marth's moves due to his end lag on his moves, however this looses to him poking with D-Tilt.
		If Marth starts to jump to beat D-Tilt, you should also start jumping to meet him in the air to anti-air him.
		But if the Marth also an instant aerial, you will want to whiff punish it or beat it out before the hit-box comes out.
		
		Being bellow Marth is also strong as he has a hard time trying to get down.

	## Gameplan (WHAT play)
		D-Tilt controls the ground in this MU, along with his long dash, this makes the ground a very strong place for both of us.
		If one Marth cannot wall out the other from the ground, they will loose to Marth's dash dance.
		Otherwise, if the Marth knows how to counter play D-Tilt, it becomes a RPS of choosing to D-Tilt, aerials, and whiff punishing.
		 You do not want to be in the air, however its one of the best counters to D-Tilt.
		So when you jump, you will want to mix-up when you jump, as otherwise it could lead to you getting anti-aired and full comboed or getting F-Smashed in the face.
		
		Once you have established center control, you will want to try and keep Marth in the corner.
		Due to Marth's long dash, positioning your self within the dash will allow you to D-Tilt him, but be ware of his Grab; This becomes less of a problem near the ledge as Marth can no longer dash back.
		You will want to cut off any grounded approach using D-Tilt, only really leaving jumping out of the corner as a approach, which is a bad option we can exploit.
		If Marth jumps out of the corner, it could lead to him getting sent of stage; This a really good position for us as Marth's recovery is very exploitable himself.
		If you don't send Marth offstage, you can try getting him above you, and due to D-Air's small size, he will struggle to get back down, just watch out for Side-B stalls.
	
	## Options to respect

		### D-Tilt
			This move controls the ground in this MU.
			On the ground, It can be beaten by CCing the weak part of it and D-Tilt-ing back or dashing out of crouch and grabbing it.
			
			In the air, you can D-Air into a grab it past 5%; and at later %s, you can N-Air / F-Air him (after they break CC).

		### F-Air
			This move controls the air in this MU.
			Walling with F-Air stops any aerial approach by Marth.
			It is also really good at laddering Marth offstage.

		### U-Air
			This move is the equivalent of an aerial dash attack.
			Marth will be using U-Air to keep Marth above you, since you has no good options bellow you, you will struggle to get down vs him
			You will need to mix up between double jumping / air dodging to a platform / ledge and stalling with Side-B to mix-up timing.
		
		### D-Air
			D-Air is one of the best ways to stop you from D-Tilt-ing, however, to get anything off it, the Marth must fall with it, meaning he has to delay the D-Air.
			This means if Marth jumps predicable or does not mix up what he does when he jumps, we can anti-air him.
		
		### F-Smash
			F-Smash is the fear that keeps you grounded, as if Marth reads you will jump and F-Smashes it, you will often die at 20%.
			However, due to its low lag, its easily whiff punished or shielded.
			
			Just watch out for if the Marth predicts you will dash back, as its quite good at covering it, often times dashing behind F-Smash is better.
		
		### Dash attack
			Marth might try to dash attack out the corner
			At when your at low % you can CC the dash attack and grab it.
			At when your at higher %s you can sheild it (when the other marth is at high %, you can up b him)

	## Options not to respect
	
		### Counter
			This move is stupid laggy, when he does it, its active for 30 frames, then vulnerable for another 30.
			If you don't want to deal with active frames, you can just grab it, otherwise change a tipper F-Smash.
		
		### Side-B
			This move is negative on CC and offstage has so much lag you can easily go off and punish it.

# Punish Game

	## Punish routes
		Marth has a terrible time coming directly down, so we can exploit this.
		Just like Sheik, you will want to find your way underneath Marth, and shark him with U-Airs, F-Airs and U-Tilts.
		After not allowing Marth down, you will be pushing him to the corners, meaning as with Fox, you can then try to finish him off with a D-Air / F-Smash / Up-B, however, if Marth is at a higher %, these often wont connect, witch is fine as Marth's edge guarding is really good vs him self.
	
	## Combos
		F-Air -> F-Smash
		F-Air -> D-Air
		D-Air -> Grab
		F-Air -> F-Air

	## Edge Guarding
		Edge guarding Marth is the key to killing him early.
		
		You will mostly be spaced to hit bad up B angles with look away CC -> D-Tilt / F-Smash; This still leaves the mix up to WD to ledge (and you can run out of crouch to run off stage), but this only works past 7%, before that, you will need to be in any action, the best one is just another D-Tilt.
		Once the Marth shows (or you know) he will mix up how he grabs the ledge, you can start to ledge hog and start to hit him offstage.
		
		### Double Jumps
			Run off fair to cover double jump and Marth Side-B-ing close to the ledge
			D-Tilt -> instant run off fair works sometimes too.
		
		### Side-B
			Marth Side-B has 21 frames of recovery in the air and stalls him in one spot vertically. This makes it really easy to react to and hit him.
			If he goes bellow ledge, you can grab the ledge for i-frames and go off and B-Air him.
			If he is far enough out, you can run off and Up-B the Side-B / him going low.
			Although these options loose to Marth Up-B-ing early.
			
			If he is horizontal to the ledge and is close enough, run off fair works to push him back.
			
			If he is above the ledge and close enough, then you continue to shark him with F-Airs and B-Airs.

	## Throw Follow ups
		Mix up between F-Throw and U-Throw, their DIs are different for each other.
		
		### Low %
			F-Throw -> Re-Grab
			F-Throw -> F-Air / N-Air
			F-Throw -> F-Smash
			U-Throw -> U-Tilt
		
		### Mid %
			U-Throw -> Juggle
			F-Throw -> Pivot F-Smash / Tech Chase
			
		
		### High %
			U-Throw -> Juggle
			F-Throw -> Pivot F-Smash / Juggle
		
		If you send Marth(& sheik / low teirs) offstage with a throw at low %s, you should dash dance to make it ambiguous weather you will WD to ledge, or come off and hit them.
		While doing this, you can WD down to D-Tilt the recovery.
			
		
# Defence
	
	CC is very strong at low % vs Marth, so while your at low %, you should be using CC to punish bad approaches; Just watch out for D-Air.
	
	## Recovery
		When recovering VS Marth, you want to make sure to be mixing-up between going low and high, as well as how close you get to the ledge.
		
		If you Side-B too close to the ledge however, you will be punished, especially if you Side-B bellow ledge, as the bubble Marth can cover increases from bellow the ledge.

Center stage is important
When marth jumps, jump with him, if he stays grounded, stay grounded
When in center, use Aerial drift
Don't act first

CC dtilt -> grab at low %
Dair dtilt attempt

Get ready for dash attack out of corner (kinda like puff side b) (CC, sheild (up b at late %) or outspace)

Up B Marth's low side B
Run off fairs to catch Double Jumps and Marth's side b
