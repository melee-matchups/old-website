# Stuff to add

## Neutral

### D-Tilt
Put Sheik Jump mode or CC mode
CC is more threatening

D-Tilt is still good at high %s

Don't worry about mashing D-Tilt at the correct / tipper range (as if they try to CC / get you, it hits again), but don't mash it at close range.




Watch out for grab

DD -> safe from grab
Have to outplay by overshoot grab



Avoid scrap
Avoid platform fighting

at CC%s vs sheik, use MAX ranged moves






CC-ing mix up with D-Tilt when you think sheik will come in
- Only worried about needle and run up grab
- Plant seed / condition them to "grab time", then go back to dash dancing


If sheik in jump mode:
- Go air to air
- Better aerial drift, fade back or in-place
- Don't do this in corner -> get back to center





## Edge guarding
Put on pressure - Go offstage
D-Smash is optimal punish for when they go on stage
Sheik is a sitting duck
Fair off stage (at like 40%)

Grab ledge for early up b



If sheik does attacks from ledge, you can amsah tech (without the sheild) to slide off to ledge


## Throws

F-Throw / D-Throw tech chase to 22%


## Sharking 101
Directly above -> Uair / Utilt(No Jump)
Side -> Fair / bair
Platforms -> mini-FD
Do have jump -> areials
No jump -> utilt

If they throw a move out horizontally when landing, whiff punish it with grab / dash attack
Bait out spot-dodge if they land with nothing / air dodge

Directly under -> watch sheik

 "gameplan": "Grab em\ndtilt pressure, the damn thing is broken, stay grounded\nCan run up and shield, but make sure they don't grab you\nAvoid the grab, so don't throw out stupid shit, you'll be grabed\nWalling with nair works too",
"respect": "Don't approach with Fair\nDI sheik dthrow up and away\n\nRespect (fully charged) needles, try not to get hit for free, and don't run at them when they do them",
"not_respect": "She can't punish tipper fsmash on shield\nif the sheik is spamming down-smash on your shield, then you can actually always shield-grab her as long as you shield DI towards her\nIf she hits your shield, you mostly always punish (mabey if she dash backs she can escape, but you can read this or cover it)\nif sheik camps, Waveland forward into downtilt\n\nBad aerial drift, can shark alot",
"edge_guarding": "Please grab ledge\nIf you are facing towards the stage and a d-throw will not allow her to freely grab the ledge, that is your option. If she does not DI properly (which is away), Marth can turnaround dtilt. Her options are extremely limited at this point because if she double-jumps and/or tries to attack, she eats a tipper fsmash (or, occasionally, counter) and loses her stock.",
