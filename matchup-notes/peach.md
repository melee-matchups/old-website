# Stuff to add

Stay on ground, your stronger there

To beat aerials, stuff them out with disjoint -> whiff punish with dash attack as you can outrange and punish while active

To beat grounded moves (cough cough dash attack), whiff punish with grab or CC

Watch out on ledge, she has alot of shit that can hit you, make sure to sweet-spot and stall bellow the stage

Treat turnips as advanced lazers, you can PS them, but also cut through them with N-Air and fair (same counter play for when they throw low turnips too)

When in corner or peach in corner, its better to do in-place moves as approaching / overshooting on peach is a bad idea as she is excellent at walling due to her hit-boxes + 0 lag aerials

play around Peach's "scare zone", so she feels threatened not to pull turnips, but can't really hit you
