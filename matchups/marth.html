						<div class="indent-tab">
							<div>D-Tilt controls the ground in this MU, along with his long dash, this makes the ground a very strong place for both of us.<br>If one Marth cannot wall out the other from the ground, they will loose to Marth's dash dance.<br>Otherwise, if the Marth knows how to counter play D-Tilt, it becomes a RPS of choosing to D-Tilt, aerials, and whiff punishing.<br> You do not want to be in the air, however its one of the best counters to D-Tilt.<br>So when you jump, you will want to mix-up when you jump, as otherwise it could lead to you getting anti-aired and full comboed or getting F-Smashed in the face.<br><br>Once you have established center control, you will want to try and keep Marth in the corner.<br>Due to Marth's long dash, positioning your self within the dash will allow you to D-Tilt him, but be ware of his Grab; This becomes less of a problem near the ledge as Marth can no longer dash back.<br>You will want to cut off any grounded approach using D-Tilt, only really leaving jumping out of the corner as a approach, which is a bad option we can exploit.<br>If Marth jumps out of the corner, it could lead to him getting sent of stage; This a really good position for us as Marth's recovery is very exploitable himself.<br>If you don't send Marth offstage, you can try getting him above you, and due to D-Air's small size, he will struggle to get back down, just watch out for Side-B stalls.</div>

							<div><h3>D-Tilt</h3><br>This move controls the ground in this MU.<br>On the ground, It can be beaten by CCing the weak part of it and D-Tilt-ing back or dashing out of crouch and grabbing it.<br><br>In the air, you can D-Air into a grab it past 5%; and at later %s, you can N-Air / F-Air him (after they break CC).<br><br><h3>F-Air</h3><br>This move controls the air in this MU.<br>Walling with F-Air stops any aerial approach by Marth.<br>It is also really good at laddering Marth offstage.<br><br><h3>U-Air</h3><br>This move is the equivalent of an aerial dash attack.<br>Marth will be using U-Air to keep Marth above you, since you has no good options bellow you, you will struggle to get down vs him<br>You will need to mix up between double jumping / air dodging to a platform / ledge and stalling with Side-B to mix-up timing.<br><br><h3>D-Air</h3><br>D-Air is one of the best ways to stop you from D-Tilt-ing, however, to get anything off it, the Marth must fall with it, meaning he has to delay the D-Air.<br>This means if Marth jumps predicable or does not mix up what he does when he jumps, we can anti-air him.<br><br><h3>F-Smash</h3><br>F-Smash is the fear that keeps you grounded, as if Marth reads you will jump and F-Smashes it, you will often die at 20%.<br>However, due to its low lag, its easily whiff punished or shielded.<br><br>Just watch out for if the Marth predicts you will dash back, as its quite good at covering it, often times dashing behind F-Smash is better.</div>

							<div><h3>Counter</h3><br>This move is stupid laggy, when he does it, its active for 30 frames, then vulnerable for another 30.<br>If you don't want to deal with active frames, you can just grab it, otherwise change a tipper F-Smash.<br><br><h3>Side-B</h3><br>This move is negative on CC and offstage has so much lag you can easily go off and punish it.</div>

						<div class="indent-tab">
							<div>Marth has a terrible time coming directly down, so we can exploit this.<br>Just like Sheik, you will want to find your way underneath Marth, and shark him with U-Airs, F-Airs and U-Tilts.<br>After not allowing Marth down, you will be pushing him to the corners, meaning as with Fox, you can then try to finish him off with a D-Air / F-Smash / Up-B, however, if Marth is at a higher %, these often wont connect, witch is fine as Marth's edge guarding is really good vs him self.</div>

						<div class="indent-tab">
							<div>Edge guarding Marth is the key to killing him early.<br><br>You will mostly be spaced to hit bad up B angles with D-Tilt / F-Smash.<br>Once the Marth shows (or you know) he will mix up how he grabs the ledge, you can start to ledge hog and start to hit him offstage.<br><br><h3>Side-B</h3><br>Marth Side-B has 21 frames of recovery in the air and stalls him in one spot vertically. This makes it really easy to react to and hit him.<br>If he goes bellow ledge, you can grab the ledge for i-frames and go off and B-Air him.<br>If he is far enough out, you can run off and Up-B the Side-B / him going low.<br>Although these options loose to Marth Up-B-ing early.<br><br>If he is horizontal to the ledge and is close enough, run off fair works to push him back.<br><br>If he is above the ledge and close enough, then you continue to shark him with F-Airs and B-Airs.</div>
