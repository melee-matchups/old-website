							<div>Once your are within distance of Foxes burst range, you will be play off of these options.<br>The most common options for Fox come after a dash or a SH, You will need to react to witch he choses and punish accordingly.<br>Additionally, you will need to observe if the Fox wishes to over extend or dash back.<br><br>After this you will want to push him offstage to gimp or edge guard him.</div>

						<div class="indent-tab">
							<div><h2>Shine</h2><br>Fox has many a option to rush-down Marth with, the most deadly of witch is his Shine.<br>Shine can be beaten by predicting where he will do it (as an undershoot or overshoot) and grabbing before or after he does it.<br>If the fox is overshooting his shine, dashing forwards to grab him before he gets it out is a good option.<br>You can also do a in-place option to beat it out such as SH delayed in-place FF fair or in-place D-Tilt.<br>If the Fox decides to do an aerial instead, you will want to try to ether whiff punish it with grab or beat it out with your sword.<br><br><h3>Aerials</h3><br>To make sure he doesn't try to attack your dash backs, you will need to mix in in-place options.<br>In-place / drift back AC N-Air is good for catching an overshoot N-Air / D-Air, but is susceptible to being hit from other options due to its small effective coverage.<br>In-place / drift back instant SHFFL F-Air is also good for catching an overshoot aerials and will also cover for full-hop aerials.<br>In-place D-Tilt is good after other options to catch the Fox running at you with unthoughtful approaches, however you don't want to be walling out with D-Tilt.<br><br>After you do N-Air / F-Air, you will need to mix-up what you do after it, such as a dash away, dash forwards, shield, D-Tilt, grab or something else; The key thing is to mix up what you do after so you don't get punished.<br><br><h3>Dash dancing</h3><br>If the Fox decides to dash dance / delay their approach, you can use D-Tilt to poke and provoke the Fox to approach.<br>You can do this by doing a run cancel D-Tilt to catch his dash back.<br>If the Fox is weary of the above option, wave dash D-Tilt also works to catch them dashing back in.<br>You can also try to use a riskier option such as dash attack and f-smash to call out the Fox.<br><br><h3>Grab</h3><br>Fox can get a 0-50% combo off of U-Throw -> U-Air; However this can be alleviated by SDI-ing the U-Air.<br>Fox can grab you if you do not mix up your aerials and if you dash back too much.<br><br><h3>Burst kill options</h3><br>At high %s Fox has alot of burst kill options or options that lead to a kill.<br>These include:<br>    - Grab<br>    - U-Smash<br>    - U-Air<br>    - Shine<br>These can be dealt with the same way as before, however the risk reward is skewed heavily for Fox, as a slip up and your dead.<br>It's better to play more cautious of these options at high %s.</div>

							<div>Fox is the fastest faller in the game, this allows Marth to basically indefinitely juggle Fox.<br>However, you do not want to juggle him forever, as Fox above you at high % isn't really that good due to his fast fall speed.<br>This means you want to use juggling as a means to combo him into a finisher.<br><br>You will want to ether:<br>    - Ladder combo him above a platform so you can land on the platform and F-Smash him.<br>    - Juggle him off stage into a D-Air, Up-B or F-Smash.</div>

							<div>Be smart, you must be aware of where and when the Fox wishes to do something<br>You must position yourself differently depending on what the Fox likes to do<br><br><h3>Side-B</h3><br>If he is above ledge, you must be ready for him to side b to a platform or at you.<br>These can be covered by a N-Air / F-Air before or just after the ledge.<br><br>He can also choose to try to snap to the ledge. If he does not space correctly, you can D-Tilt the side B.<br>Otherwise, you will need to D-Air or ledge hog the Side-B.<br><br>I found I can also use Neutral-B to cover ledge for side Bs, however this is really slow and is more of a call out.<br><br><h3>Up-B</h3><br>Up-B can be covered in many ways depending on the angle by the Fox.<br><br><h4>Above ledge</h4><br><br>    If fox is above ledge and far enough away from you, he with ether Up B:<br>    - towards you / to ledge, witch you can cover with a F-Air / F-Smash.<br>    - to a platform, witch you can F-Air / N-Air (later %s).<br>    - horizontality to stage, witch you can F-Smash<br>    <br>    If Fox is close enough, you can go out and D-Air / F-Air him.<br><h4>Below ledge</h4><br>    If it will hit you, you can opt for a counter; However, if the Fox can snap to ledge, you can mix it up and hog the ledge or D-Air him.<br>    If Fox is close enough to the ledge when he Up-Bs, you can use the ledge i-frames to go and hit the fox with side B, B-Air or F-Air.<br>    <br>    If the Fox is further away but still in reach, you should go out and F-Air / Up-B him.<br>    <br>    If he aims for the ledge, you can D-Air him, however watch out he does not wall tech it.</div>
