# Due to me finding note taking esaier in markdown, I have canged the website to be markdown driven, for the sake of preservation, I have left this up


This is my github where I keep all my notes on melee

I am a Marth main, so all these notes will be through the lens of Marth

See quick MU notes [here](quick-notes.md) website [here](https://melee-matchups.github.io/)
