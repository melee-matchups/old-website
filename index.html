			<p>This is my website where I keep all my notes on melee</p>
			<pre>
Practice routine:
	• Basics
		• Short hops
		• Spaceing / micro spaceing
		• Sh Aerials (fastfall)
		• Retreating Aerials (remember nair)
		• Fh Aerials
		• Reverse jab
		• Isa
	• Movement
		• Dash dance
		• Platform walk & micro walk
		• Platform dash
		• Shield dashing
		• Shield stopping
		• Da cancelling
		• Wave dash / wave landing
		• OoS
		• NIL(s)
	• Tech
		• B reverse
		• Instant dash attack
		• Ledge dash / inv ledge fair
		• Pivots
		• Teaching
		• RAR
		• Powersheilding
		• Isai drop / circle drop
		• Sheild drop
	• Combos
	• CPU teaching (send them into tech chase)
	• CPU punish (punish their laggy moves with optimal punish)


Disadvantage = option select, with respect to position

Work on:
	• Character
		• Movement to different points
		• Combos
		• OOS
	• Tech
		• L cancels lol
		• Defence (Cc / asdi / amsh tech)
		• Play faster (IpM)
	• Habits
		• Side Bs
		• Fair at ledge
		• Stop fsmash in neutral
		• Stop jumping to ledge when recovering
		• JC grabs
	• Mind 
		• Problem solve as I play
		• Remain calm (nerves + anger) / Patience & reaction
		• Stay engaged and react to what is around you
		• Plan of approach / Mix ups (dont just run in) / Neutral triangle more, conditioning & mix ups (POKE > OVERSHOOT > WHIFF PUNISH > POKE)
		

fair -> dair (ken combo)
Uair / fair -> fsmash (late uair or plat assisted)
grab combos (fast fallers)
fthrow -> pivot fsmash (floaties)
dair -> dair (floaties)
fair -> up b (di in)
side b -> utilt (floaties in air)
techchase -> dsmash



Problem solve as you play, question where they do / what leads up to, their option and why

Mix up timing and option

Don't run away,
stay at the distance where you AND YOUR OPPONENT can burst, as they won't feel like they need to push a button if
1: your not close enough to hit them for undershooting, and it makes your approaches reactable
2: your not close enough to be hit by them, so they wont attack
This range changes per character, and slightly per player

Some goals of neutral:
- Find the pressure distance
- Inspect playstyle and preferred neutral options
- Keep track of habits / commitments
- ask questions, such as why was I hit, what lead up to X, then problem solve them in game



My playstyle:
pressure with grounded movement, Push opponent into the corner


@Netplay - Singles Any advice as we play would be appreciated.
(If you see me doing something stupid / have advice during game, please tell me so I can adapt please)

Any last tips / things you saw / anything you want to say?
